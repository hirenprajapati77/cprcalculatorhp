## [v1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Signal Quality Gates (Phase 1)**: Categorizes signals into `TRADEABLE`, `WATCHLIST`, and `LOW_QUALITY` based on ATR-normalized momentum and structural liquidity rules.
- **Regime Filtering**: Incorporates broader market trend (NIFTY 50) and volatility state to filter low-probability setups natively.
- **Execution Realism (Phase 2)**: Added dynamic slippage mapping (based on liquidity tier and volatility) and adverse-gap penalties (3x multiplier on stop-loss blow-throughs).
- **Event Risk Profiling**: Integrated `EventCalendarService` to cross-reference overnight signals with upcoming corporate events (Earnings, Dividends) and macro policies, mapping them to 0-100 severity scores.
- **Observability & Journaling (Phase 3)**: Built the server-side Trade Journal with immutable signal metadata snapshots at execution time (`eventRiskScore`, `qualityBucketAtSignal`, `regimeSnapshot`).
- **Analytics UI**: New tabular analytics mode inside the Journal to audit execution variance, Win Rate by Quality Bucket, and Performance by Market Regime.
- **Operational Runbook**: Created `ops/RUNBOOK.md` covering pre-market shadow validation checklists and degraded-mode behaviors.
- **Health Telemetry**: Added `/api/health` exposing JSON metrics on database connectivity, Redis cache availability, and precise data-freshness timestamps for Event data and Regime states.
- **Shadow Mode Guardrails**: Introduced explicit `EXECUTION_MODE` (`SHADOW` vs `LIVE`) in `.env` to prevent accidental broker routing during real-world paper validation.

### Changed
- **Degraded Mode Hardening**: Missing or stale event calendar data (older than 72 hours) now conservatively falls back to `100` (Max Risk) rather than `0` to prevent blindly taking positions during unknown event windows.
- Re-organized project root by moving loose shell scripts and SQL dumps to `ops/`, `scripts/`, and `sql/` directories for better repository hygiene.
